As seen in this graph, speeding is the most frequently issued offense, while aggressive driving has shown little change over the years. Now that we have identified the most common offenses, we will examine the neighborhoods. In (@fig-income), we explore the relationship between neighborhood incomes and the number of offenses committed. This data comes from the 2015 Toronto Neighborhood Profiles, which is a census that collects information on households, including age, sex, education, and, for our purposes, income. Specifically, we will analyze the 2016 census data, focusing on _id 1030, "Average after-tax income of households in 2015 ($)," to approximate neighborhood income. In @sec-data-cleaning, we discuss the selection of neighborhoods and the rationale behind these choices.

Abstract
This paper examines the relationship between traffic offenses and neighborhood income in Toronto. Using police reports from 2014 to 2023 and income data from the 2016 Toronto neighborhood census, we analyze how offenses such as speeding, aggressive driving, and distracted driving vary across income levels. Through visualizations and linear regression models, we find that while a weak positive correlation exists between neighborhood income and the frequency of citations, other factors likely contribute to traffic violations. Our findings raise questions about equitable enforcement practices and suggest further research into socioeconomic disparities in traffic offense distributions.

help me fix my grammar "  The main focus of this paper is to determine whether there is a relationship between the number of offences and the income of a neighborhood. The results indicate that the relationship is weak but present, with aggressive driving and speeding showing the strongest connections to income. This raises questions about why wealthier neighborhoods are penalized more than lower-income ones. Perhaps wealthier neighborhoods have more speed cameras, or maybe speed cameras in lower-income areas are vandalized more frequently. It is also possible that police are targeting wealthier individuals, or that wealthier individuals are more willing to pay speeding tickets, while those in lower-income neighborhoods are more restrained to speed. These questions lead to broader inquiries, such as whether fines should be income-adjusted. "

Can you fix my grammar: "# Model {#sec-model}
The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly, is there a relationship between the income and how much offences they get. Secondly, how strong is this relationship. 
We will be using Simple Linear Regression model to see the effect of income and the number of citations given in that neighborhood. Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].
## Model set-up
Define $y_i$ as the number offences done by a certain neighborhood. Then $x_i$ is the average income of a certain neighborhood measured in thousands.  
\begin{align} 
E(Y|X)Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1(X)
\end{align}
### Model justification
The reason a linear regression model was specifically chosen was because we want to analyze the effect of an increase of citation. As the income of the neighborhood increases or decreases, do offences go down or do they go up? This will allow us to see how strong of a relationship there is between citations and average neighbourhood income. We could add more add variables to anaylze, but it that would go out of the scope of this analysis as this is trying to find if there even is a correlation between income and offences. 
# Results {#sec-results}
The linear regression model was applied to analyze the relationship between neighborhood income and the number of traffic offences. The model's equation is as follows:
E(Y|X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{average\_income}
where \( Y \) is the number of tickets issued, and \( X \) is the average income in thousands. The summary of the linear regression model is shown below:@ressidual_plots.
We expect a positive relationship between the number offences given and the lower the income of the neighborhood. In particular... 
Our results are summarized in @ressidual_plots. Residual vs. Predictors, Residuals vs. fitted values and Normal quantile-quantile are all used to verify that our 4 assumptions of linear regression models aren't violation and that the data is works as intended. We can see that Linearity is  [TODO: check if linarity is violated]. Uncorrelated errors is [TODO: check if uncorralted isnt violated], and constant error is [TODO: check if constant error isnt varied], lastly nromality of errors [TODO: check if normal]. Give all these assumptions, we can [TODO: check if we can trust results of linear regression]

# Model {#sec-model}
The goal of our modeling strategy is twofold. First, to determine whether there is a relationship between neighborhood income and the number of offenses. Second, to assess how strong this relationship is.  
We will use a simple linear regression model to examine the effect of income on the number of citations issued in each neighborhood. Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].
## Model Setup
Define \( y_i \) as the number of offenses in a given neighborhood, and \( x_i \) as the average income of that neighborhood measured in thousands.
\[
E(Y|X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1(X)
\]
### Model Justification
A linear regression model was chosen because it allows us to analyze the effect of income on the number of citations. As neighborhood income increases or decreases, do offenses decrease or increase? This will help us evaluate the strength of the relationship between citations and average neighborhood income. While we could add more variables for a deeper analysis, that would fall outside the scope of this paper, which is focused solely on determining if a correlation exists between income and offenses.
# Results {#sec-results}
The linear regression model was applied to examine the relationship between neighborhood income and the number of traffic offenses. The model's equation is as follows:
\[
E(Y|X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{average\_income}
\]
where \( Y \) is the number of tickets issued, and \( X \) is the average income in thousands. The summary of the linear regression model is provided below in @ressidual_plots.
We expect a negative relationship between the number of offenses and neighborhood income, meaning that as income decreases, offenses increase. Our results are summarized in @ressidual_plots. Residuals vs. Predictors, Residuals vs. Fitted Values, and Normal Q-Q plots are used to verify that the four key assumptions of linear regression are not violated and that the model fits the data appropriately. We will assess whether linearity [TODO: check if linearity is violated], uncorrelated errors [TODO: check if uncorrelated errors are violated], constant variance [TODO: check for homoscedasticity], and normality of errors [TODO: check for normality] hold. Given these assumptions, we will [TODO: assess whether the results of the linear regression can be trusted].

Daivd: can you fix my grammar : "# Discussion
## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}
To begin, we should look at the main purpose of this paper, and that is to see if there is a relationship between the amount of offences and the income of that neighbourhood. As we can see [TODO: Talk about models results]
## Second discussion point
This model only takes a look at two variables. The income and the number of offences per neighbourhood. This model does not capture all the possible factors that may affect the number of ciations a neighbourhood gets. If roads are busier there is a higher likelihood for it to get more offences than quieter neighbourhoods. This would have to get looked at in more detail by adding more variables like road safety data, traffic volume, or demographic factors. 
## Third discussion point
[TODO: How this information can help the public]
## Weaknesses and next steps
There could potentially be bias in the data, as the income of neighbourhoods could affect the amount of police activity in the neighbourhood. There are assumptions made in linearl regression model, and it is further discussed in  @sec-model-details how effective our model is. The next steps for this paper would be to incorporate additional variables to give a better picture of all the potential effects that can affect the amount of citations a neighbourhood gets. We could also use more sophisticated models that can give us a more accurate picture of the effect of income and offences commited. Lastly, this data does not tell us which offences were police error and later dropped once reviewed. "

First Discussion Point {#sec-first-point}
To begin, we should focus on the main purpose of this paper, which is to determine whether there is a relationship between the number of offenses and the income of a neighborhood. As we can see from the results, [TODO: Discuss model results].
Second Discussion Point
This model only considers two variables: the income and the number of offenses per neighborhood. It does not account for all possible factors that may influence the number of citations a neighborhood receives. For example, busier roads are more likely to have more offenses than quieter neighborhoods. Future analysis would need to examine these factors in more detail by incorporating variables such as road safety data, traffic volume, or demographic factors.
Third Discussion Point
[TODO: Discuss how this information can help the public].
Weaknesses and Next Steps
There may be bias in the data, as the income of a neighborhood could influence the amount of police activity in that area. This would lead to more citations being issued in lower-income neighborhoods due to higher police presence. Additionally, the linear regression model we used makes certain assumptions, which are further discussed in @sec-model-details, regarding how well the model fits the data.
The next steps for this research would be to incorporate additional variables to provide a more comprehensive picture of the factors influencing the number of citations a neighborhood receives. Furthermore, using more sophisticated models could yield a more accurate understanding of the relationship between income and traffic offenses. Lastly, the data does not account for citations that were dismissed or dropped after being reviewed, which could affect the accuracy of the results.






Linear Regression Model:
David: 
Can you make sure you give me the residual vs fitted, qq residuals and residual vs predictor graphs with this code only: "plot_residual_diagnostics(all_models[["Total_Tickets_model"]])"

ChatGPT:
To ensure you get the Residuals vs Fitted, Normal Q-Q, and Residuals vs Predictor plots, you can explicitly modify the plot_residual_diagnostics function to generate these three plots. For the Residuals vs Predictor plot, you'll need to specify a particular predictor (e.g., Income) to use in that plot. Here's how you can adjust your code:
Updated Code:
r
Copy code
#### Load necessary libraries ####
library(here)
#### Load saved models ####
all_models <- readRDS(here::here("models/all_offence_models.rds"))
#### Function to plot the required 3 diagnostic plots ####
plot_residual_diagnostics <- function(model, predictor_var) {
  # Set up a layout with 1 row and 3 columns
  par(mfrow = c(1, 3), mar = c(5, 4, 2, 1) + 0.1)  # Adjust margins for better spacing

  # 1. Residuals vs Fitted Values
  plot(model, which = 1, main = "Residuals vs Fitted")
  
  # 2. Normal Q-Q Plot
  plot(model, which = 2, main = "Normal Q-Q")
  
  # 3. Residuals vs Predictor (use the specified predictor variable)
  plot(fitted(model), resid(model), main = paste("Residuals vs", predictor_var), 
       xlab = predictor_var, ylab = "Residuals")
}
#### Plot the diagnostics for the Total_Tickets_model ####
# Assume 'Income' is the predictor variable you want to plot against residuals
plot_residual_diagnostics(all_models[["Total_Tickets_model"]], predictor_var = "Income")
Explanation of Changes:
Residuals vs Fitted (Plot 1): plot(model, which = 1) generates the Residuals vs Fitted Values plot.
Normal Q-Q (Plot 2): plot(model, which = 2) generates the Normal Q-Q plot.
Residuals vs Predictor (Custom Plot): The third plot explicitly plots residuals against the values of a specified predictor (Income in this case) using the plot() function.
Key Parameters:
fitted(model): Extracts the fitted values from the model.
resid(model): Extracts the residuals from the model.
predictor_var = "Income": You can replace "Income" with any other predictor you want to use for the Residuals vs Predictor plot.
This code will now generate the three specific diagnostic plots you requested when you call:

#### Merge datasets by neighbourhood ####
# Ensure both datasets have a common key to merge on, like 'neighbourhood'
merged_data <- inner_join(tickets_data, income_data, by = "neighbourhood")
#### Model data ####
# Assuming `tickets_issued` is the column for number of tickets and `average_income` is the column for income
first_model <- lm(tickets_issued ~ average_income, data = merged_data)
#### Save model ####
saveRDS(

To modify the code so that it only shows the three specific residual diagnostic plots—Residuals vs. Fitted Values, Normal Q-Q Plot, and Residuals vs. Predictors Plot—you need to selectively plot only these elements for each model. Here's how you can do it:
r
Copy code
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-ResidualDiagnostics
#| fig-cap: "Diagnostic plots to assess residuals."
#| fig-subcap: ["Residuals vs. Fitted Values", "Normal Q-Q Plot", "Residuals vs. Predictors"]
#| layout-ncol: 2
#### Load necessary libraries ####
library(here)
#### Load saved models ####
all_models <- readRDS(here::here("models/all_offence_models.rds"))
#### Function to plot only 3 diagnostic plots ####
plot_residual_diagnostics <- function(model) {
  # Set up a 2x2 plot layout but only use 3 plots
  par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
  # 1. Residuals vs Fitted Values
  plot(model, which = 1, main = "Residuals vs Fitted")
  # 2. Normal Q-Q Plot
  plot(model, which = 2, main = "Normal Q-Q")
  # 3. Residuals vs Leverage (Predictors)
  plot(model, which = 3, main = "Residuals vs Predictors")
}
#### Loop through each model and plot only the 3 chosen diagnostics ####
for (model_name in names(all_models)) {
  cat("Diagnostic plots for", model_name, "\n")  # Label each set of plots
  plot_residual_diagnostics(all_models[[model_name]])  # Plot specific residual diagnostics for the current model
}
Key Changes:
plot(model, which = 1): Plots the Residuals vs Fitted Values.
plot(model, which = 2): Plots the Normal Q-Q Plot.
plot(model, which = 3): Plots the Scale-Location or Residuals vs Predictors.
par(mfrow = c(2, 2)): Sets a 2x2 plot grid but only 3 plots will be filled.
This will generate the three specified diagnostic plots for each model: Residuals vs. Fitted Values, Normal Q-Q Plot, and Residuals vs. Predictors. You can modify the which argument to focus on any specific plot type, depending on what you need.




Dataset Cleaning: 
David: 
for income_and_offences with "[1] "HOOD_158"            "NEIGHBOURHOOD_158.x" "Income"              "Total_Tickets"       "Aggressive_Driving"  "All_CAIA"            "Distracted_Driving" 
[8] "Other_HTA"           "Speeding"    " can you delete rows that are outliers

ChatGPT:
To remove outliers from your dataset, income_and_offences, you can use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and remove rows where any of the numeric columns (e.g., Income, Total_Tickets, etc.) have outliers. Here's how you can apply the IQR method to detect and remove rows that contain outliers:
Steps:
Define Outliers: For each numeric column, values are considered outliers if they are below Q1 - 1.5*IQR or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR, where Q1 is the first quartile (25th percentile) and Q3 is the third quartile (75th percentile).
Remove Rows with Outliers: Any row where one or more columns have outliers is removed.
Code Example:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
# Define a function to identify and remove outliers using IQR
remove_outliers <- function(df) {
  # Select only the numeric columns (Income, Total_Tickets, Aggressive_Driving, etc.)
  numeric_cols <- df %>% select(Income, Total_Tickets, Aggressive_Driving, All_CAIA, Distracted_Driving, Other_HTA, Speeding)
  # Calculate IQR for each numeric column
  Q1 <- apply(numeric_cols, 2, quantile, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
  Q3 <- apply(numeric_cols, 2, quantile, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
  IQR <- Q3 - Q1
  # Define limits for outliers
  lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
  upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
  # Filter the data to remove rows with outliers
  filtered_df <- df %>%
    filter(
      Income >= lower_bound["Income"] & Income <= upper_bound["Income"] &
      Total_Tickets >= lower_bound["Total_Tickets"] & Total_Tickets <= upper_bound["Total_Tickets"] &
      Aggressive_Driving >= lower_bound["Aggressive_Driving"] & Aggressive_Driving <= upper_bound["Aggressive_Driving"] &
      All_CAIA >= lower_bound["All_CAIA"] & All_CAIA <= upper_bound["All_CAIA"] &
      Distracted_Driving >= lower_bound["Distracted_Driving"] & Distracted_Driving <= upper_bound["Distracted_Driving"] &
      Other_HTA >= lower_bound["Other_HTA"] & Other_HTA <= upper_bound["Other_HTA"] &
      Speeding >= lower_bound["Speeding"] & Speeding <= upper_bound["Speeding"]
    )
  return(filtered_df)
}
# Apply the function to your dataset
cleaned_data <- remove_outliers(income_and_offences)
# View the cleaned data
print(cleaned_data)
Explanation:
apply(numeric_cols, 2, quantile, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE): Computes the 25th percentile (Q1) for each numeric column.
apply(numeric_cols, 2, quantile, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE): Computes the 75th percentile (Q3) for each numeric column.
IQR <- Q3 - Q1: Calculates the interquartile range for each numeric column.
lower_bound and upper_bound: Defines the range for non-outliers using the formula [𝑄1−1.5×𝐼𝑄𝑅,𝑄3+1.5×𝐼𝑄𝑅]
[Q1−1.5×IQR,Q3+1.5×IQR].
filter(): Removes rows where any of the numeric columns fall outside the calculated IQR bounds.
This will give you a cleaned version of the income_and_offences dataset with outliers removed. Let me know if you need further adjustments!


David: 
can you help me fix this "summary_neighbourhood_data <- raw_offence_data %>%
  group_by(NEIGHBOURHOOD_158, HOOD_158) %>%
  summarise(Total_Tickets = sum(TICKET_COUNT), .groups = 'drop')" i want the headers to be NEIGHBOURHOOD_158, HOOD_158, a total ticket_count , then total aggressive driving, then total ALL CAIA, then total Disctracted Driving, then total Other HTA, then Speeding. 
  
Chat-GPT: 
to achieve the result you want, we can modify your code to:
Group the data by NEIGHBOURHOOD_158 and HOOD_158.
Calculate the total tickets for each offense type (Aggressive Driving, All CAIA, Distracted Driving, Other HTA, and Speeding).
Summarize the total counts for each category as well as the total ticket count across all categories.
Here's the adjusted code to achieve this:
r
Copy code
# Summarize the data for each neighborhood
summary_neighbourhood_data <- raw_offence_data %>%
  group_by(NEIGHBOURHOOD_158, HOOD_158) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_Tickets = sum(TICKET_COUNT, na.rm = TRUE),
    Aggressive_Driving = sum(TICKET_COUNT[OFFENCE_CATEGORY == "Aggressive Driving"], na.rm = TRUE),
    All_CAIA = sum(TICKET_COUNT[OFFENCE_CATEGORY == "All CAIA"], na.rm = TRUE),
    Distracted_Driving = sum(TICKET_COUNT[OFFENCE_CATEGORY == "Distracted Driving"], na.rm = TRUE),
    Other_HTA = sum(TICKET_COUNT[OFFENCE_CATEGORY == "Other HTA"], na.rm = TRUE),
    Speeding = sum(TICKET_COUNT[OFFENCE_CATEGORY == "Speeding"], na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )
# View the summary data
print(summary_neighbourhood_data)
Explanation:
group_by(NEIGHBOURHOOD_158, HOOD_158): Groups the data by neighborhood and hood.
summarise(): Summarizes the data to calculate:
Total_Tickets: Sum of all tickets.
Aggressive_Driving, All_CAIA, Distracted_Driving, Other_HTA, Speeding: Sum of tickets for each offense category using conditional subsetting with OFFENCE_CATEGORY == "Category_Name".
na.rm = TRUE: Ensures that any missing values (NAs) are ignored in the calculations.
This will give you a data frame where the columns are:
NEIGHBOURHOOD_158
HOOD_158
Total_Tickets (total ticket count)
Aggressive_Driving
All_CAIA
Distracted_Driving
Other_HTA
Speeding
Each row corresponds to a neighborhood, with the total ticket counts and the counts for each specific offense category. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

David: 
raw_offence_data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/raw_offences_data.csv")
new_offence_data <- subset(as.data.frame(raw_offence_data), select = c(OFFENCE_YEAR, OFFENCE_CATEGORY, HOOD_158, NEIGHBOURHOOD_158, TICKET_COUNT))
new_offence_data
For this dataset, each row represents a different entry logging the offence committed, the year, and the number of tickets issued. I want to create a cleaned dataset organized by neighbourhood name. The top row should contain the names of the neighbourhoods, and the rows below should summarize the types of offences committed, the years in which they occurred, and the corresponding ticket counts.

Chat-GPT:
To create a dataset where the top column represents the neighbourhoods and the rows summarize the offences, years, and ticket counts, you can follow these steps. This process involves:
Selecting the relevant columns.
Summarizing the offences by neighbourhood, offence year, and offence category.
Reshaping the dataset so that each neighbourhood is a column with the offence details summarized below.
Here’s how you can achieve this:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
# Load the dataset
raw_offence_data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/raw_offences_data.csv")

# Select the relevant columns
new_offence_data <- raw_offence_data %>%
  select(OFFENCE_YEAR, OFFENCE_CATEGORY, HOOD_158, NEIGHBOURHOOD_158, TICKET_COUNT)
# Summarize the data by neighbourhood, year, and offence category
summary_data <- new_offence_data %>%
  group_by(NEIGHBOURHOOD_158, OFFENCE_YEAR, OFFENCE_CATEGORY) %>%
  summarise(Total_Tickets = sum(TICKET_COUNT), .groups = 'drop')

# Reshape the data so that the neighbourhoods are the columns
reshaped_data <- summary_data %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = NEIGHBOURHOOD_158,  # Neighbourhoods will be the columns
    values_from = Total_Tickets,      # Values will be the total ticket counts
    names_glue = "{NEIGHBOURHOOD_158}"  # Column names will be the neighbourhood names
  )
# View the reshaped data
print(reshaped_data)
Explanation:
Data Selection: We select the relevant columns: OFFENCE_YEAR, OFFENCE_CATEGORY, HOOD_158, NEIGHBOURHOOD_158, and TICKET_COUNT.
Summarization: Using group_by(), the data is grouped by NEIGHBOURHOOD_158, OFFENCE_YEAR, and OFFENCE_CATEGORY, and we calculate the total number of tickets using summarise().
Reshaping: We use pivot_wider() to convert the NEIGHBOURHOOD_158 column into individual columns representing each neighbourhood. The values inside these columns will be the total ticket counts for each offence category and year.
Result:
Each column will be a neighbourhood, and the rows will summarize the total tickets issued for each offence category and year. If you want additional detail, such as separating offence types in the rows, further customization can be done.
Let me know if you need more specific adjustments!

David: 
Can you fix my code 
common_columns <- intersect(names(reshaped_data)[-c(1, 2)], names(income_data_cleaned))
reshaped_data_filtered <- reshaped_data %>%
  select(c("OFFENCE_YEAR", "OFFENCE_CATEGORY", common_columns))
income_data_cleaned_filtered <- income_data_cleaned %>%
  select(common_columns)
combined_data <- bind_rows(reshaped_data_filtered, income_data_cleaned_filtered)
print(combined_data)
write_csv(combined_data, "data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv")
The problem is that the rthere is two columns in reshaped_Data that isnt on income_Data which are [1] "OFFENCEYEAR"                      "OFFENCECATEGORY"  , id like you to leave those columns as they are. they are the only exception

Chat-GPT: 
To fix your code while keeping the OFFENCEYEAR and OFFENCECATEGORY columns in reshaped_data, you need to ensure that these columns are excluded from the comparison between reshaped_data and income_data_cleaned, but still retained in the final combined dataset.
Here's the updated code:
r
Copy code
#### Merge cleaned neighborhood and offences data set and Save data ####
# Assuming both reshaped_data and income_data_cleaned are already loaded
# Align the column names of both datasets if necessary
# Make sure the column names of reshaped_data match the format in income_data_cleaned
# Find the common columns between both datasets (excluding the first two columns in reshaped_data)
common_columns <- intersect(names(reshaped_data)[-c(1, 2)], names(income_data_cleaned))
# Filter both datasets to keep only the common columns
# For reshaped_data, keep the "OFFENCEYEAR", "OFFENCECATEGORY", and the common neighborhood columns
reshaped_data_filtered <- reshaped_data %>%
  select(c("OFFENCEYEAR", "OFFENCECATEGORY", common_columns))
# For income_data_cleaned, keep only the common neighborhood columns
income_data_cleaned_filtered <- income_data_cleaned %>%
  select(common_columns)
# Now append the rows of income_data_cleaned under reshaped_data
# This assumes that both datasets are aligned correctly by column
# For the two columns 'OFFENCEYEAR' and 'OFFENCECATEGORY', fill missing values in income_data_cleaned with NA
income_data_cleaned_filtered <- income_data_cleaned_filtered %>%
  mutate(OFFENCEYEAR = NA, OFFENCECATEGORY = NA)
# Bind the two datasets, ensuring proper alignment
combined_data <- bind_rows(reshaped_data_filtered, income_data_cleaned_filtered)
# View the final combined dataset
print(combined_data)
# Save the combined data to a CSV file
write_csv(combined_data, "data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv")
Explanation:
Common Columns: We identify the common neighborhood columns between reshaped_data and income_data_cleaned (excluding "OFFENCEYEAR" and "OFFENCECATEGORY" from reshaped_data).
Filter Datasets: We filter both datasets to retain only the common columns and ensure that reshaped_data keeps the "OFFENCEYEAR" and "OFFENCECATEGORY" columns.
Mutate: For income_data_cleaned, we add two new columns (OFFENCEYEAR and OFFENCECATEGORY) and fill them with NA to match the structure of reshaped_data.
Bind Rows: We then combine both datasets (reshaped_data_filtered and income_data_cleaned_filtered) using bind_rows().
Save Output: Finally, we save the resulting combined data as a CSV file.
This will merge the datasets while keeping "OFFENCEYEAR" and "OFFENCECATEGORY" intact. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

David: 
in this code: "#### Clean Neighborhood data ####
# Load the raw data
raw_neighbourhood_data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/raw_neighbourhood_data.csv")
# Rename the '_id' column to 'id'
raw_neighbourhood_data <- raw_neighbourhood_data %>%
  rename(id = _id)
# Filter rows where id is equal to 1030
income_data <- raw_neighbourhood_data %>%
  filter(id == 1030)
# Remove the first 6 columns
income_data_cleaned <- income_data %>%
  select(-c(1:6))" also include id == 1

ChatGPT:
To include rows where id is equal to either 1030 or 1, you can modify the filter condition using the %in% operator to check for both values. Here's how you can adjust the code:
r
Copy code
#### Clean Neighborhood data ####
# Load the raw data
raw_neighbourhood_data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/raw_neighbourhood_data.csv")
# Rename the '_id' column to 'id'
raw_neighbourhood_data <- raw_neighbourhood_data %>%
  rename(id = `_id`)
# Filter rows where id is equal to 1030 or 1
income_data <- raw_neighbourhood_data %>%
  filter(id %in% c(1030, 1))
# Remove the first 6 columns
income_data_cleaned <- income_data %>%
  select(-c(1:6))
# View the cleaned data
print(income_data_cleaned)
Explanation:
filter(id %in% c(1030, 1)): This line filters the data to include rows where the id column is either 1030 or 1.

David: 
i want you to merge both of these datasets: "names(income_data)
[1] "NEIGHBOURHOOD_158" "HOOD_158"          "Income"           
> names(summary_neighbourhood_data)
[1] "NEIGHBOURHOOD_158" "HOOD_158"          "Total_Tickets"    " you should go by hood_158 to merge both datasets. There is neighbourhoods not in income_data that there is in summary_neighbourhood_data and vice versa. So make sure that each point goes where it should go. At the end of the merging, the final dataset should have names(income_and_offences) [1] "NEIGHBOURHOOD_158" "HOOD_158"          "Income"    ""Total_Tickets" 

ChatGPT:
To merge the two datasets income_data and summary_neighbourhood_data based on the column HOOD_158, we can use the merge() function in R. This will allow us to perform a full join (including all rows from both datasets, even if some HOOD_158 values are missing in one dataset).
Here’s how you can do it:
r
Copy code
# Assuming income_data and summary_neighbourhood_data are your two datasets
# Perform a full join by HOOD_158
income_and_offences <- merge(income_data, summary_neighbourhood_data, 
                             by = "HOOD_158", 
                             all = TRUE)  # 'all=TRUE' performs a full outer join
# View the merged data
head(income_and_offences)
# Check the column names of the merged dataset to ensure they match the required output
names(income_and_offences)
Explanation:
merge(income_data, summary_neighbourhood_data, by = "HOOD_158", all = TRUE) merges both datasets on the HOOD_158 column and includes all rows from both datasets, ensuring that neighborhoods present in one dataset but not the other are also included.
If a neighborhood is missing in one dataset, the corresponding columns (such as Income or Total_Tickets) will be filled with NA.
The resulting dataset income_and_offences will have the columns NEIGHBOURHOOD_158, HOOD_158, Income, and Total_Tickets.
After this, you should have the merged dataset with the required columns. Let me know if you need any further customization!

David: 
can you clean my income_and_offences: "#### Merge cleaned neighborhood and offences data set and Save data ####
# Perform a full join by HOOD_158
income_and_offences <- merge(income_data, summary_neighbourhood_data, 
                             by = "HOOD_158", 
                             all = TRUE) 
income_and_offences <- income_and_offences %>%
  select(-c(4:4))" so that if columns 3 and 4 get check for an NA. If an NA occurs, delete that row

ChatGPT:
To clean the income_and_offences dataset and remove rows where either Income (column 3) or Total_Tickets (column 4) contains an NA, you can use the na.omit() function or filter() from the dplyr package. Here's how to do it with dplyr:
r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
#### Merge cleaned neighborhood and offences data set and Save data ####
# Perform a full join by HOOD_158
income_and_offences <- merge(income_data, summary_neighbourhood_data, 
                             by = "HOOD_158", 
                             all = TRUE)
# Remove rows where either Income (column 3) or Total_Tickets (column 4) is NA
income_and_offences_cleaned <- income_and_offences %>%
  filter(!is.na(Income) & !is.na(Total_Tickets))
# View the cleaned dataset
head(income_and_offences_cleaned)
Explanation:
filter(!is.na(Income) & !is.na(Total_Tickets)): This ensures that both Income and Total_Tickets columns are checked for NA values. Rows containing NA in either of these columns will be removed.
The final cleaned dataset is stored in income_and_offences_cleaned.
This should effectively clean your dataset by removing any rows where Income or Total_Tickets is missing. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

David: 
help me make a bar graph that takes tickets_data <- read.csv(here::here("data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv")) with headers [1] "NEIGHBOURHOOD_158" "HOOD_158"          "OFFENCE_YEAR"      "OFFENCE_CATEGORY"  "Total_Tickets"  and looks at offence_category and for every year that an offence was commited of that offence, it creates a new bar for that offence_category. At the end I need a graph that shows me the offences commited on the y axis, x axis is the type, and the bars represent the year

ChatGPT:
To create a bar graph that shows the number of offenses (from OFFENCE_CATEGORY) for each year, grouped by offense type, you can use ggplot2. Here is the step-by-step R code to achieve that, assuming your dataset has the structure you mentioned:
Required Steps:
Group the data by OFFENCE_CATEGORY and OFFENCE_YEAR.
Summarize the total tickets for each combination of OFFENCE_CATEGORY and OFFENCE_YEAR.
Plot a bar graph where the x-axis represents the OFFENCE_CATEGORY, the y-axis represents the number of offenses (Total Tickets), and different bars represent the year.
Code:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(dplyr)
# Load the dataset
tickets_data <- read.csv(here::here("data", "analysis_data", "analysis_data.csv"))
# Summarize the data to get the total tickets per Offence Category and Year
tickets_summary <- tickets_data %>%
  group_by(OFFENCE_CATEGORY, OFFENCE_YEAR) %>%
  summarize(Total_Tickets = sum(Total_Tickets, na.rm = TRUE))
# Create the bar plot
ggplot(tickets_summary, aes(x = OFFENCE_CATEGORY, y = Total_Tickets, fill = as.factor(OFFENCE_YEAR))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +  # Position bars side by side for each year
  labs(title = "Total Offenses per Category by Year",
       x = "Offense Category",
       y = "Total Tickets",
       fill = "Offense Year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels for readability
Explanation:
group_by(OFFENCE_CATEGORY, OFFENCE_YEAR): Groups the data by offense category and year.
summarize(Total_Tickets = sum(Total_Tickets, na.rm = TRUE)): Summarizes the total number of tickets (offenses) for each combination of offense category and year.
geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge"): Creates a bar graph, with side-by-side bars (position = "dodge") for each offense category and year.
fill = as.factor(OFFENCE_YEAR): Different bars for each year are colored separately using the year as the grouping factor.
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)): Rotates the x-axis labels to prevent overlap and improve readability.
This code will produce a bar graph where each OFFENCE_CATEGORY is displayed on the x-axis, the number of offenses (tickets) is on the y-axis, and the bars for each offense type are grouped by the year in which the offenses occurred.
Let me know if you need further adjustments!

David: 
can you help me create 5 subplots similar to the first scatterplot, but instead of income vs total_tickets it will be income vs ""Total_Tickets"       "Aggressive_Driving"  "All_CAIA"            "Distracted_Driving" 
[8] "Other_HTA"           "Speeding"      "

ChatGPT:
To create 5 subplots with different offense categories (i.e., Aggressive_Driving, All_CAIA, Distracted_Driving, Other_HTA, Speeding), you can make use of facet_wrap in ggplot2 or create individual plots and combine them using gridExtra or patchwork. Here, I’ll guide you on how to do both.
Option 1: Using facet_wrap for a Single Plot with Subplots
You can create one plot and use facet_wrap to automatically generate subplots for each offense type. This assumes you reshape your data from wide format to long format.
Reshaping Data to Long Format
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(scales)
# Load the dataset
income_data <- read.csv(here::here("data", "analysis_data", "income_and_offences.csv"))
# Reshape data from wide to long format for offense categories
long_income_data <- income_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Total_Tickets", "Aggressive_Driving", "All_CAIA", 
                        "Distracted_Driving", "Other_HTA", "Speeding"), 
               names_to = "Offense_Category", 
               values_to = "Offense_Tickets")
# Create the scatterplot with faceting for each offense category
ggplot(long_income_data, aes(x = Income, y = Offense_Tickets)) +
  geom_point(color = "black", alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +  # Format x-axis with comma-separated labels
  labs(title = "Income vs Offense Tickets by Neighbourhood",
       x = "Income",
       y = "Tickets Count") +
  facet_wrap(~ Offense_Category, scales = "free_y") +  # Create a subplot for each offense category
  theme_minimal()
Option 2: Using gridExtra for Separate Plots
If you prefer individual plots and want to combine them into a grid, you can use the gridExtra library:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(gridExtra)
# Load the dataset
income_data <- read.csv(here::here("data", "analysis_data", "income_and_offences.csv"))
# Create individual scatterplots for each offense type
p1 <- ggplot(income_data, aes(x = Income, y = Total_Tickets)) +
  geom_point(color = "black", alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Income vs Total Tickets", x = "Income", y = "Total Tickets") +
  theme_minimal()
p2 <- ggplot(income_data, aes(x = Income, y = Aggressive_Driving)) +
  geom_point(color = "black", alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Income vs Aggressive Driving", x = "Income", y = "Aggressive Driving Tickets") +
  theme_minimal()
p3 <- ggplot(income_data, aes(x = Income, y = All_CAIA)) +
  geom_point(color = "black", alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Income vs All CAIA", x = "Income", y = "All CAIA Tickets") +
  theme_minimal()
p4 <- ggplot(income_data, aes(x = Income, y = Distracted_Driving)) +
  geom_point(color = "black", alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Income vs Distracted Driving", x = "Income", y = "Distracted Driving Tickets") +
  theme_minimal()
p5 <- ggplot(income_data, aes(x = Income, y = Other_HTA)) +
  geom_point(color = "black", alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Income vs Other HTA", x = "Income", y = "Other HTA Tickets") +
  theme_minimal()
# Arrange the plots in a grid
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, ncol = 2)
Key Changes:
pivot_longer() reshapes the data from wide format (multiple columns for different offense types) into a long format suitable for faceting.
facet_wrap(~ Offense_Category) generates subplots for each offense type.
In Option 2, separate plots (p1, p2, p3, etc.) are created for each offense type, and grid.arrange() combines them into a grid.
Let me know if you have a preference or need further modifications!
