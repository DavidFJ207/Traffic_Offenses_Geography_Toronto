Can you fix my grammar: "# Model {#sec-model}
The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly, is there a relationship between the income and how much offences they get. Secondly, how strong is this relationship. 
We will be using Simple Linear Regression model to see the effect of income and the number of citations given in that neighborhood. Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].
## Model set-up
Define $y_i$ as the number offences done by a certain neighborhood. Then $x_i$ is the average income of a certain neighborhood measured in thousands.  
\begin{align} 
E(Y|X)Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1(X)
\end{align}
### Model justification
The reason a linear regression model was specifically chosen was because we want to analyze the effect of an increase of citation. As the income of the neighborhood increases or decreases, do offences go down or do they go up? This will allow us to see how strong of a relationship there is between citations and average neighbourhood income. We could add more add variables to anaylze, but it that would go out of the scope of this analysis as this is trying to find if there even is a correlation between income and offences. 
# Results {#sec-results}
The linear regression model was applied to analyze the relationship between neighborhood income and the number of traffic offences. The model's equation is as follows:
E(Y|X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{average\_income}
where \( Y \) is the number of tickets issued, and \( X \) is the average income in thousands. The summary of the linear regression model is shown below:@ressidual_plots.
We expect a positive relationship between the number offences given and the lower the income of the neighborhood. In particular... 
Our results are summarized in @ressidual_plots. Residual vs. Predictors, Residuals vs. fitted values and Normal quantile-quantile are all used to verify that our 4 assumptions of linear regression models aren't violation and that the data is works as intended. We can see that Linearity is  [TODO: check if linarity is violated]. Uncorrelated errors is [TODO: check if uncorralted isnt violated], and constant error is [TODO: check if constant error isnt varied], lastly nromality of errors [TODO: check if normal]. Give all these assumptions, we can [TODO: check if we can trust results of linear regression]

# Model {#sec-model}
The goal of our modeling strategy is twofold. First, to determine whether there is a relationship between neighborhood income and the number of offenses. Second, to assess how strong this relationship is.  
We will use a simple linear regression model to examine the effect of income on the number of citations issued in each neighborhood. Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].
## Model Setup
Define \( y_i \) as the number of offenses in a given neighborhood, and \( x_i \) as the average income of that neighborhood measured in thousands.
\[
E(Y|X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1(X)
\]
### Model Justification
A linear regression model was chosen because it allows us to analyze the effect of income on the number of citations. As neighborhood income increases or decreases, do offenses decrease or increase? This will help us evaluate the strength of the relationship between citations and average neighborhood income. While we could add more variables for a deeper analysis, that would fall outside the scope of this paper, which is focused solely on determining if a correlation exists between income and offenses.
# Results {#sec-results}
The linear regression model was applied to examine the relationship between neighborhood income and the number of traffic offenses. The model's equation is as follows:
\[
E(Y|X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{average\_income}
\]
where \( Y \) is the number of tickets issued, and \( X \) is the average income in thousands. The summary of the linear regression model is provided below in @ressidual_plots.
We expect a negative relationship between the number of offenses and neighborhood income, meaning that as income decreases, offenses increase. Our results are summarized in @ressidual_plots. Residuals vs. Predictors, Residuals vs. Fitted Values, and Normal Q-Q plots are used to verify that the four key assumptions of linear regression are not violated and that the model fits the data appropriately. We will assess whether linearity [TODO: check if linearity is violated], uncorrelated errors [TODO: check if uncorrelated errors are violated], constant variance [TODO: check for homoscedasticity], and normality of errors [TODO: check for normality] hold. Given these assumptions, we will [TODO: assess whether the results of the linear regression can be trusted].

Daivd: can you fix my grammar : "# Discussion
## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}
To begin, we should look at the main purpose of this paper, and that is to see if there is a relationship between the amount of offences and the income of that neighbourhood. As we can see [TODO: Talk about models results]
## Second discussion point
This model only takes a look at two variables. The income and the number of offences per neighbourhood. This model does not capture all the possible factors that may affect the number of ciations a neighbourhood gets. If roads are busier there is a higher likelihood for it to get more offences than quieter neighbourhoods. This would have to get looked at in more detail by adding more variables like road safety data, traffic volume, or demographic factors. 
## Third discussion point
[TODO: How this information can help the public]
## Weaknesses and next steps
There could potentially be bias in the data, as the income of neighbourhoods could affect the amount of police activity in the neighbourhood. There are assumptions made in linearl regression model, and it is further discussed in  @sec-model-details how effective our model is. The next steps for this paper would be to incorporate additional variables to give a better picture of all the potential effects that can affect the amount of citations a neighbourhood gets. We could also use more sophisticated models that can give us a more accurate picture of the effect of income and offences commited. Lastly, this data does not tell us which offences were police error and later dropped once reviewed. "

Discussion
First Discussion Point {#sec-first-point}
To begin, we should focus on the main purpose of this paper, which is to determine whether there is a relationship between the number of offenses and the income of a neighborhood. As we can see from the results, [TODO: Discuss model results].
Second Discussion Point
This model only considers two variables: the income and the number of offenses per neighborhood. It does not account for all possible factors that may influence the number of citations a neighborhood receives. For example, busier roads are more likely to have more offenses than quieter neighborhoods. Future analysis would need to examine these factors in more detail by incorporating variables such as road safety data, traffic volume, or demographic factors.
Third Discussion Point
[TODO: Discuss how this information can help the public].
Weaknesses and Next Steps
There may be bias in the data, as the income of a neighborhood could influence the amount of police activity in that area. This would lead to more citations being issued in lower-income neighborhoods due to higher police presence. Additionally, the linear regression model we used makes certain assumptions, which are further discussed in @sec-model-details, regarding how well the model fits the data.
The next steps for this research would be to incorporate additional variables to provide a more comprehensive picture of the factors influencing the number of citations a neighborhood receives. Furthermore, using more sophisticated models could yield a more accurate understanding of the relationship between income and traffic offenses. Lastly, the data does not account for citations that were dismissed or dropped after being reviewed, which could affect the accuracy of the results.

#### Workspace setup ####
library(tidyverse)
library(rstanarm)
#### Read data ####
income_data <- read_csv("data/sim_data/average_income.csv")
tickets_data <- read_csv("data/sim_data/tickets_issued_data.csv")
### Model data ####
first_model <- lm(tickets_issued$ticketd_data ~ average_income$income_data)
#### Save model ####
saveRDS(
  first_model,
  file = "models/offence_linear_regression.rds"
)


Chat-GPT4:
Here’s the fixed R code for your linear regression model that analyzes the relationship between neighborhood income and traffic offenses in Toronto:
Corrected the syntax of the linear model formula.
Fixed how the datasets are referenced inside the formula.
Made sure the column names are correctly matched between the datasets.
r
Copy code
#### Workspace setup ####
library(tidyverse)
#### Read data ####
income_data <- read_csv("data/sim_data/average_income.csv")
tickets_data <- read_csv("data/sim_data/tickets_issued_data.csv")
#### Merge datasets by neighbourhood ####
# Ensure both datasets have a common key to merge on, like 'neighbourhood'
merged_data <- inner_join(tickets_data, income_data, by = "neighbourhood")
#### Model data ####
# Assuming `tickets_issued` is the column for number of tickets and `average_income` is the column for income
first_model <- lm(tickets_issued ~ average_income, data = merged_data)
#### Save model ####
saveRDS(
  first_model,
  file = "models/offence_linear_regression.rds"
)
Key changes:
Merging the datasets: Used inner_join() on the common column neighbourhood to combine both datasets, assuming that’s the key.
Correct linear model: Updated the formula lm(tickets_issued ~ average_income, data = merged_data) to reference the correct columns from the merged dataset.
Saving the model: The model is saved in the models directory.
This code should now correctly fit the linear model. Let me know if you need further adjustments or explanations!
